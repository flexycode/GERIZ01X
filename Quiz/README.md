### Activity Problem:

Nationalistic concept that the Filipinos, and not the foreigners, were
the “fair hope of the mother  land. Do you agree with Rizal? expalin in 2-3 sentences

## ✨ Answer:

```code
Yes, I agree with Dr. José Rizal's nationalistic concept that the Filipinos, not the foreigners, are the "fair hope of the motherland."
This idea emphasizes the importance of Filipino self-reliance and empowerment, suggesting that the country's future depends on the
efforts and abilities of its own people. By entrusting the nation's development to Filipinos, Rizal's concept
promotes a sense of ownership and responsibility among the citizens.

I'm really drawn to Slovenia, partly because my idol Luka Dončić is from there, he is a Slovenian professional
basketball player who plays for the Dallas Mavericks of the NBA and he also represents the Slovenian national team.
I'd love to explore Bled Island, soak up the local culture and try all the amazing food like goulash
and Štruklji, a slovenian cheese dumplings.
I also want to visit some stunning architecture of places like the Ljubljana Castle and the Triple Bridge.
