My Answer for this activity:


During Jos√© Rizal's time, a hero with courage and intelligence was needed to challenge the abuses of the Spanish colonizers. The worst problem the Filipinos faced back then was the oppression and exploitation by the Spanish, which made their lives difficult and hindered their progress. Rizal's writings and ideas inspired the Filipinos to fight for their freedom and rights. He became a symbol of hope and courage for the Filipino people.
